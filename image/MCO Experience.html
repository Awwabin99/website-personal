	<p><font size="+2"color="black"FACE="Berlin Sans FB"> Assalamualaikum everyone, today i would like to share to all of you about my experience during Movement Control Order or also known as MCO. First of all, there are a lot of things that can be done during this MCO period. Actually, to tell you all the truth, when our Prime Minister annouced that our beloved country will take this step to fight Covid-19 Pandemic, i feel so sad and dissapointed. This is because, i know that i cannot go outside anymore except if i had a good reason such us to buy groceries, go to hospital or clinic. I also cannot do my routine activitiea anymore such as play football, pray at the mosque, hang out with friends, go to university and many more. 
		<p>
			Now i would like to share to all of you my activities that i went through during this MCO period. Actually, there are a lot of things that i do and most of that I will do it with my family. Th first activity that I would like to share are i learn a little bit on how to cook with my mother. For sure before this, I do not like to cook and only know to eat. For me, cooking is a good activity, this is because it teach us on how to be patient and focus during cooking. So this is the picture of food on what i had made during this MCO times.

    <p><font size="+2"color="black"FACE="Berlin Sans FB"> Next, for the second activities that I do during this quarantine time is watching korean drama (kdrama). I watch the kdrama with my sister. This is because she always insisted me to watch the kdrama with her. We usually watch kdrama in the evening and sometimes at night. I think this activity can strength my bond more with her because I usually do not have enough time to spent with her because of before this, during my leisure time, most of my activities are with my friend. 
    	<p>
    		Lastly, I also feel very grateful because, during this quarantine time that are almost reach 1 month, my father always tell us to perform prayer together. I feel very happy because before MCO, I did not have any chance to pray with my family because my mother and father sometimes busy with their work and most of my time i will pray at the mosque. This MCO really taught me that whatever happens in our life, family always comes number one. Times that I spent with my family are worthwhile. I hope eventhough this MCO has come to the end, my bonding with my family will come stronger than before. In Shaa Allah..
